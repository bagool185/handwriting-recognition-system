# Handwritting Recognition System

Python built handwritten digits recognition system using the [k-NN algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm/).

# Prerequisites

In order to run it you'll need:

* [The MNIST data set](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
* [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-363/)
* [python-mnist](https://github.com/sorki/python-mnist/)
* [PyQt5](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyQt5/)
* [numpy](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html/)
* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html/)

# Further instructions

Place the ubyte files from MNIST into a directory called MNIST_samples and put in the same directory as the .py files.

In order to run it, open the terminal / cmd in the same directory as the .py files and type python kNN.py
